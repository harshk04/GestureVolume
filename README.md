# GestureVolume

GestureVolume is a Python-based project that enables volume control on a computer using hand gestures. It utilizes computer vision techniques and inbuilt modules to recognize hand gestures and adjust the system volume accordingly.


## Features
Hand gesture recognition: GestureVolume uses computer vision algorithms to detect and recognize hand gestures.

**Volume control:** The project allows users to control the system volume by performing specific hand gestures.

**Real-time adjustment:** The volume changes are applied in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user.

**Platform independence:** GestureVolume is designed to work on multiple platforms, as it utilizes inbuilt modules that are available across different operating systems.


## Dependencies
To run GestureVolume, you need the following dependencies:

1. Python (version 3.7 or higher)

2. OpenCV

3. Numpy

4. Time

5. HandTracking Module

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install opencv-python numpy`


## Usage
To use GestureVolume, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your_username/gesturevolume.git`

Navigate to the project directory:
`cd gesturevolume`

Run the gesture volume control script:
`python gesture_volume.py`

Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the hand gesture recognition.
Once calibrated, you can control the system volume by performing the specified hand gestures. Adjust your hand position according to the instructions displayed on the screen.


## Customization
GestureVolume provides options for customization based on your specific requirements. Here are a few customization possibilities:

**Gesture recognition:** You can modify or extend the hand gestures recognized by GestureVolume by modifying the gesture recognition logic in the code.

**Volume control behavior:** Adjust the volume control behavior, such as the step size or sensitivity, to suit your preferences by modifying the corresponding parameters in the code.

**User interface:** Enhance the user interface by adding additional visual elements or integrating with other libraries to provide a more user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore these customization options to adapt GestureVolume to your needs and preferences.
